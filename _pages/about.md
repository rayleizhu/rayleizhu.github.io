I got my PhD degree from [CityUHK](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/) under the supervision of [Prof. Rynson W.H. Lau](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KilQqKYAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) in July, 2024. Before that, I received my bachelor degree in Computer Science and Engineering from [Dalian University of Technology](https://en.dlut.edu.cn/) (**rank 1/102**) and spent one year as PhD student at [CUHK](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html) under the supervision of [Eric Lo](https://appsrv.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~ericlo/).

My research focus on **hardware-efficient architecture design**, **LLM inference acceleration**, and **(vision)-language foundation models**. Before finalizing PhD research topic on effective attention mechanisms, I actively explored several topics such as 3D vision, data-efficient learning and low-level vision. Through all these trials, I have built a good understanding on **GPUs**, **deep learning systems**, and strong skills on **experiment automation**. During the journey, I published **8 papers in top venues (including 4 first-author ones)**, and earned **750+ citations (640+ from first-author papers)**.
